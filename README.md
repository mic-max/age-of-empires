Age of Empires 1 Clone

I'm going to be trying to make a Real Time Strategy game using proper object oriented practices.
At first I will be making a clone of Age of Empires since it's a great game and I won't have to spend time thinking of ideas for characters or making art assets. I'll focus on making the code structure first and then when that all seems complete add a game engine to the project, either in 2D or 3D.
This is for learning purposes don't sue me Microsoft :fearful:
